<h1 align="center">Vuex ORM Plugin: vuex-orm-crud</h1>

[Vuex-ORM](https://github.com/vuex-orm/vuex-orm) brings Object-Relational Mapping to the Vuex Store. @wgr-sa/vuex-orm-crud lets you communicate with RESTful backends.

The plugin extends the basic model of Vuex-ORM with some helful functions to make CRUD operations such as save, get, paginate, update, delete.

You no longer need to access your http client manually. All the communication happens thru the enhanced Vuex-ORM models.
